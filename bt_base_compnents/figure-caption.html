    Figure <figure> & Figcaption <figcaption> Elements

    (for additional information about the <img> element, see img.html)


    The <figure> element is self-contained content, with optional caption,
    that is related to, but not reliant on, the main flow of a document.

    A <figure> and it's contents should make sense if moved throughout a
    document, or if removed from a document entirely.

    ___

    <figcaption> is an optional element that represents a caption
    or legend associated with a figure (image, illustration, diagram
    or code snippet).

    It must be a direct child of the <figure> element, but it can be
    placed first or last inside the element.


    Example: First

    <figure>
      <img />
      <figcaption></figcaption>
    </figure>


    Example: Last

    <figure>
      <figcaption></figcaption>
      <img />
    </figure>

  Example 1: Solo figure

-->

<figure>
  <img src="https://d26nzsixr14s87.cloudfront.net/series/132x176/2042.jpg" alt="The Cat In The Hat poster artwork" />
</figure>


<!--

  Example 2: Figure With Caption

  Note: when using both alternative text and a figure caption, the figure caption
  should take on the bulk of the image description, and the alternative text can
  be reduced to minimal information. Never duplicate the alternative text to be used
  as the figure caption, as screen readers will then present a user with duplicate
  information.
