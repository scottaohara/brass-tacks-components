    Image <img> Element


    The image element behaves as an inline-block. It can take
    height and width via inline attributes or (preferably) via CSS.

    For accessibility compliance, <img>'s should always have the
    alt attribute set. However, the alt attribute may not actually
    need to have a set value.

    See the figure/figure caption example for information on how
    the <img> elements works with those elements.

<!--

    Example 1:

    Default use case for an image element

-->

<img src="http://placekitten.com/96/140" alt="write descriptive alternative text here" />


<br />
<br />


<!--

    Example 2:

    Image as pure decoration

    Images that are purely meant as decoration to accompany additional
    elements should still have the alt attribute, but it should be set
    to empty.
